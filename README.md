## ❯ Getting Started

### Step 1: Set up the Development Environment

You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- on OSX use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) `brew install node`
- on Windows use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) `choco install nodejs`

Install yarn globally

```bash
yarn global add yarn
```

Install a MySQL database.

> If you work with a mac, we recommend to use homebrew for the installation.

### Step 2: Create new Project

Fork or download this project. Configure your package.json for your new project.

Then copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. In this file you have to add your database connection information.

Create a new database with the name you have in your `.env`-file.

Then setup your application environment.

```bash
yarn run setup
```

> This installs all dependencies with yarn. After that it migrates the database and seeds some test data into it. So after that your development environment is ready to use.

### Step 3: Serve your App

Go to the project dir and start your app with this yarn script.

```bash
yarn start serve
```

> This starts a local server using `nodemon`, which will watch for any file changes and will restart the server according to these changes.
> The server address will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`.

![divider](./w3tec-divider.png)

## ❯ Scripts and Tasks

All script are defined in the `package-scripts.js` file, but the most important ones are listed here.

### Install

- Install all dependencies with `yarn install`

### Linting

- Run code quality analysis using `yarn start lint`. This runs tslint.
- There is also a vscode task for this called `lint`.

### Tests

- Run the unit tests using `yarn start test` (There is also a vscode task for this called `test`).
- Run the integration tests using `yarn start test.integration`.
- Run the e2e tests using `yarn start test.e2e`.

### Running in dev mode

- Run `yarn start serve` to start nodemon with ts-node, to serve the app.
- The server address will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`

### Building the project and run it

- Run `yarn start build` to generated all JavaScript files from the TypeScript sources (There is also a vscode task for this called `build`).
- To start the builded app located in `dist` use `yarn start`.

### Database Migration

- Run `typeorm migration:create -n <migration-file-name>` to create a new migration file.
- Try `typeorm -h` to see more useful cli commands like generating migration out of your models.
- To migrate your database run `yarn start db.migrate`.
- To revert your latest migration run `yarn start db.revert`.
- Drops the complete database schema `yarn start db.drop`.

### Database Seeding

- Run `yarn start db.seed` to seed your seeds into the database.

![divider](./w3tec-divider.png)

## ❯ Debugger in VSCode

To debug your code run `yarn start build` or hit <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> to build your app.
Then, just set a breakpoint and hit <kbd>F5</kbd> in your Visual Studio Code.

![divider](./w3tec-divider.png)

## ❯ API Routes

The route prefix is `/api` by default, but you can change this in the .env file.
The swagger and the monitor route can be altered in the `.env` file.

| Route          | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| **/api**       | Shows us the name, description and the version of the package.json |
| **/graphql**   | Route to the graphql editor or your query/mutations requests |
| **/swagger**   | This is the Swagger UI with our API documentation |
| **/monitor**   | Shows a small monitor page for the server |
| **/api/users** | Example entity endpoint |
| **/api/pets**  | Example entity endpoint |

## ❯ Logging

Our logger is [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston). To log http request we use the express middleware [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan).
We created a simple annotation to inject the logger in your service (see example below).

```typescript
import { Logger, LoggerInterface } from '../../decorators/Logger';

@Service()
export class UserService {

    constructor(
        @Logger(__filename) private log: LoggerInterface
    ) { }

    ...
```

![divider](./w3tec-divider.png)

## ❯ Event Dispatching

We use this awesome repository [event-dispatch](https://github.com/pleerock/event-dispatch) for event dispatching.
We created a simple annotation to inject the EventDispatcher in your service (see example below). All events are listed in the `events.ts` file.

```typescript
import { events } from '../subscribers/events';
import { EventDispatcher, EventDispatcherInterface } from '../../decorators/EventDispatcher';

@Service()
export class UserService {

    constructor(
        @EventDispatcher() private eventDispatcher: EventDispatcherInterface
    ) { }

    public async create(user: User): Promise<User> {
        ...
        this.eventDispatcher.dispatch(events.user.created, newUser);
        ...
    }
```

## ❯ Seeding

Isn't it exhausting to create some sample data for your database, well this time is over!

How does it work? Just create a factory for your entities (models) and a seed script.

### 1. Create a factory for your entity

For all entities we want to seed, we need to define a factory. To do so we give you the awesome [faker](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) library as a parameter into your factory. Then create your "fake" entity and return it. Those factory files should be in the `src/database/factories` folder and suffixed with `Factory` like `src/database/factories/UserFactory.ts`.

Settings can be used to pass some static value into the factory.

```typescript
define(User, (faker: typeof Faker, settings: { roles: string[] }) => {
    const gender = faker.random.number(1);
    const firstName = faker.name.firstName(gender);
    const lastName = faker.name.lastName(gender);
    const email = faker.internet.email(firstName, lastName);

    const user = new User();
    user.firstName = firstName;
    user.lastName = lastName;
    user.email = email;
    user.roles = settings.roles;
    return user;
});
```

Handle relation in the entity factory like this.

```typescript
define(Pet, (faker: typeof Faker, settings: undefined) => {
    const gender = faker.random.number(1);
    const name = faker.name.firstName(gender);

    const pet = new Pet();
    pet.name = name;
    pet.age = faker.random.number();
    pet.user = factory(User)({ roles: ['admin'] })
    return pet;
});
```

### 2. Create a seed file

The seeds files define how much and how the data are connected with each other. The files will be executed alphabetically.
With the second function, accepting your settings defined in the factories, you are able to create different variations of entities.

```typescript
export class CreateUsers implements Seeder {

    public async run(factory: Factory, connection: Connection): Promise<any> {
        await factory(User)({ roles: [] }).createMany(10);
    }

}
```

Here an example with nested factories. You can use the `.map()` function to alter
the generated value before they get persisted.

```typescript
...
await factory(User)()
    .map(async (user: User) => {
        const pets: Pet[] = await factory(Pet)().createMany(2);
        const petIds = pets.map((pet: Pet) => pet.Id);
        await user.pets().attach(petIds);
    })
    .createMany(5);
...
```

To deal with relations you can use the entity manager like this.

```typescript
export class CreatePets implements Seeder {

    public async seed(factory: FactoryInterface, connection: Connection): Promise<any> {
        const em = connection.createEntityManager();

        await times(10, async (n) => {
            // This creates a pet in the database
            const pet = await factory(Pet)().create();
            // This only returns a entity with fake data
            const user = await factory(User)({ roles: ['admin'] }).make();
            user.pets = [pet];
            await em.save(user);
        });
    }

}
```

### 3. Run the seeder

The last step is the easiest, just hit the following command in your terminal, but be sure you are in the projects root folder.

```bash
yarn start db.seed
```

![divider](./w3tec-divider.png)

## ❯ GraphQL

For the GraphQL part we used the library [TypeGraphQL](https://19majkel94.github.io/type-graphql/) to build awesome GraphQL API's.

The context(shown below) of the GraphQL is builded in the **graphqlLoader.ts** file. Inside of this loader we create a scoped container for each incoming request.

```typescript
export interface Context {
  requestId: number;
  request: express.Request;
  response: express.Response;
  container: ContainerInstance;
}
```

### DataLoader

For the usage of the DataLoaders we created a annotation, which automatically creates and registers a new DataLoader to the scoped container.

Here is an example of the **PetResolver**.

```typescript
import DataLoader from 'dataloader';
import { DLoader } from '../../decorators/DLoader';
    ...
    constructor(
        private petService: PetService,
        @Logger(__filename) private log: LoggerInterface,
        @DLoader(UserModel) private userLoader: DataLoader<string, UserModel>
    ) { }
    ...
```

Or you could use the repository too.

```typescript
@DLoader(UserRepository) private userLoader: DataLoader<string, UserModel>
```

Or even use a custom method of your given repository.

```typescript
@DLoader(PetRepository, {
    method: 'findByUserIds',
    key: 'userId',
    multiple: true,
}) private petLoader: DataLoader<string, PetModel>
```

## ❯ Docker

### Install Docker

Before you start, make sure you have a recent version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) installed

### Build Docker image

```shell
docker build -t <your-image-name> .
```

### Run Docker image in container and map port

The port which runs your application inside Docker container is either configured as `PORT` property in your `.env` configuration file or passed to Docker container via environment variable `PORT`. Default port is `3000`.

#### Run image in detached mode

```shell
docker run -d -p <port-on-host>:<port-inside-docker-container> <your-image-name>
```

#### Run image in foreground mode

```shell
docker run -i -t -p <port-on-host>:<port-inside-docker-container> <your-image-name>
```

### Stop Docker container

#### Detached mode

```shell
docker stop <container-id>
```

You can get a list of all running Docker container and its ids by following command

```shell
docker images
```

#### Foreground mode

Go to console and press <CTRL> + C at any time.

### Docker environment variables

There are several options to configure your app inside a Docker container

#### project .env file

You can use `.env` file in project root folder which will be copied inside Docker image. If you want to change a property inside `.env` you have to rebuild your Docker image.

#### run options

You can also change app configuration by passing environment variables via `docker run` option `-e` or `--env`.

```shell
docker run --env DB_HOST=localhost -e DB_PORT=3306
```

#### environment file

Last but not least you can pass a config file to `docker run`.

```shell
docker run --env-file ./env.list
```

`env.list` example:

```
# this is a comment
DB_TYPE=mysql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
```
